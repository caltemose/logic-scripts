# logic-scripts

Scripts for the Logic Scripter Plugin. Work in Progress. Currently not intended for public consumption. Mileage may vary.

Scripts:

- random-note-filter.js this takes existing MIDI input on a track and randomly filters it out. it does not create new notes; you must have existing MIDI already captured on the track to which you apply this script.
- random-note-and-pitch-filter.js this does the same thing as random-note-filter.js but also randomly changes the pitch of the given note to another value in the scale you provide in the plugin controls.
